# Terminal Emulator

## Project Description
This project aims to emulate the bash terminal functionality (and more!) through the use of python's OS module.  

## Installation 
To run this application, please take the following steps: 
1. Fork and clone the following repositiory to your local machine:
    https://github.com/maiyuzhe/phase-3-project-terminal-emulator/tree/main
2. Cd into the directory you cloned the repository into
3. Run: 
    ```
    pipenv install 
    pipenv shell 
    pip install pyautogui 
    ```
4. To start the python script: 
    ```
     python(3) lib/cli.py
    ```
5. After running the prompt you will be given a prompt:

    ![Propmt](Assets/prompt.png)

    Enter blue pill (no quotes) to stay within the emulator.  Enter red pill for a surprise!
    ***Note: entering red pill at the prompt will end the program***

6. You are now inside of an emulated terminal (within your own terminal).  Enter commands to try it out (i.e. cd, ls, mkdir, open)

## Commands
1. cd 
2. ls
3. mkdir
4. open (no quotes)
5. remove (no quotes)
6. touch 
7. diplay (custom feature)
